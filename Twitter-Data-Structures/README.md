    The GUI interface has two main windows. 1) the login screen, and 2) the user's main menu. A user cannot use any of the twitter interface until they are logged in or register as a new user. Once logged in, the user can perform AND/OR searches (search), save the twitter data (save user data), save the connected components (save connected components), view trending topics (trending topics), or add tweets/followers (show tweets). Clicking show tweets will open up a new window where the user can add tweets, followers, and view his/her main and mention feeds.

    To switch users, simply logout from the user's main menu and log in as a different user. A user can only view and add tweets as themself; that is, Tommy cannot add tweets for Jill.
